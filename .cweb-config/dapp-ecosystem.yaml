# This is a "index source" that specifies the dApp world as you see it.
#
# This index defines what interpreters, contract templates etc you want
# to use, and what they should be called.
#
# You can include external sources for this information in the `includes`
# section, and you include your own smart contract in the `contract_templates`
# section.

# We currently use a reference to the in-house ecosystem definition file for devnet.
